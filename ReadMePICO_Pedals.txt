

A LITTLE ABOUT THE PROJECT...

This is primarily focusing on developing for the Raspberry Pi on a Windows PC.
I have included a link to the github providing the code to install a development kit on a Windows environment (1).
However, to run "natively", Raspberry Pi has more support when developing on another Raspberry Pi unit (1,2,3,4,Zero,etc)
or on a Linux based environment, and as I don't have any MAC equipment, I shall not be focusing on any issues involving MAC 
specific problems (sorry!)
